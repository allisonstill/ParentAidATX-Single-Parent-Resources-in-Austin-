From finding out that her baby is a boy (and getting used to the idea) to finding out that her best friend and greatest supporter Pam will die of cancer (and not getting used to that idea), with a generous amount of wit and faith (but very little piousness), Lamott narrates the great and small events that make up a woman’s life. \\\"Lamott is a wonderfully lithe writer ....

Learning to handle all the many duties that two people would normally deal with and adjusting to the overwhelming demands of a child on a daily basis is a trying experience. Yet, the U.S. Census Bureau estimated in 2006 that over 12.9 million single parents raise their children alone. While a small percentage of that was single fathers (2.5 million), the hard reality of raising a child alone remains the same for either parent. Through hours of meticulous research and interviews, this book was compiled to show exactly how a single father can raise a child alone to be happy and healthy without the help of a second parent. You will learn, as a single father, how to reassure your children and maintain the feeling of a family. You will learn how to help them feel better regardless of whether you are a single father through death or divorce. You will learn how to treat your children and how to communicate with them. The basics of discipline and rules will be outlined for a single-parent household, along with tips on how you can have fun with your children the right and healthy way. You will learn the differences between having daughters versus sons as a father, and how to handle the myriad issues that the mother would normally handle. Dozens of hours of interviews with experts in child psychology and child raising were conducted, and have been included in this book to provide a complete outline of what you can expect throughout raising your children. You will learn how to turn your house into a home, divvying up space, having pets, and how to handle chores. You will learn how to find reliable child care and how to juggle your time among your work, your children, and yourself. You will learn how to deal with school and ensure that your children get the attention they need to succeed. The basics of cooking and health care for children and how to handle their emotional issues as they grow older will all be outlined for you.

Growing from these foundations, this book explains the latest landscape in flexible working, looking at employee psychological health and productivity, including showing up for work sick. Perspectives are provided from around the world on leadership, line management, ‘over attachment’ with technology, commuting, skill-based inequality and control over working time.

Little children come into the world hardwired to learn in virtually any setting and about any matter. Yet in today’s preschool and kindergarten classrooms, learning has been reduced to scripted lessons and suspect metrics that too often undervalue a child’s intelligence while overtaxing the child’s growing brain. These mismatched expectations wreak havoc on the family: parents fear that if they choose the “wrong” program, their child won’t get into the “right” college. But Yale early childhood expert Erika Christakis says our fears are wildly misplaced. Our anxiety about preparing and safeguarding our children’s future seems to have reached a fever pitch at a time when, ironically, science gives us more certainty than ever before that young children are exceptionally strong thinkers. In her pathbreaking book, Christakis explains what it’s like to be a young child in America today, in a world designed by and for adults, where we have confused schooling with learning. She offers real-life solutions to real-life issues, with nuance and direction that takes us far beyond the usual prescriptions for fewer tests, more play. She looks at children’s use of language, their artistic expressions, the way their imaginations grow, and how they build deep emotional bonds to stretch the boundaries of their small worlds. Rather than clutter their worlds with more and more stuff, sometimes the wisest course for us is to learn how to get out of their way. Christakis’s message is energizing and reassuring: young children are inherently powerful, and they (and their parents) will flourish when we learn new ways of restoring the vital early learning environment to one that is best suited to the littlest learners. This bold and pragmatic challenge to the conventional wisdom peels back the mystery of childhood, revealing a place that’s rich with possibility.\",\n        \"id\": 210,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=wS46CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=wS46CQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=single+parent+childcare&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=40&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$8.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 342,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2016-02-09\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 2,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"The Importance of Being Little\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Emma Johnson\",\n        \"cat\": \"Family & Relationships\",\n        \"description\": \"When Emma Johnson's marriage ended she found herself broke, pregnant, and alone with a toddler.

With significantly more hours spent outside the home, single working mothers face a serious childcare crunch—how can they provide quality care for their children? In Putting Children First, Ajay Chaudry follows 42 low-income families in New York City over three years to illuminate the plight of these mothers and the ways in which they respond to the difficult challenge of providing for their children's material and developmental needs with limited resources. Using the words of the women themselves, Chaudry tells a startling story. Scarce subsidies, complicated bureaucracies, inflexible work schedules, and limited choices force families to piece together care arrangements that are often unstable, unreliable, inconvenient, and of limited quality. Because their wages are so low, these women are forced to rely on inexpensive caregivers who are often under-qualified to serve the developmental needs of their children. Even when these mothers find good, affordable care, it rarely lasts long because their volatile employment situations throw their needs into constant flux. The average woman in Chaudry's sample had to find five different primary caregivers in her child's first four years, while over a quarter of them needed seven or more in that time. This book lets single, low-income mothers describe the childcare arrangements they desire and the ways that options available to them fail to meet even their most basic needs. As Chaudry tracks these women through erratic childcare spells, he reveals the strategies they employ, the tremendous costs they incur and the anxiety they face when trying to ensure that their children are given proper care. Honest, powerful, and alarming, Putting Children First gives a fresh perspective on work and family for the disadvantaged. It infuses a human voice into the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of welfare reform, showing the flaws of a social policy based solely on personal responsibility without concurrent societal responsibility, and suggesting a better path for the future.\",\n        \"id\": 212,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=oeSFAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=oeSFAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=childcare+for+single+parents&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=40&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$29.95\",\n        \"pageCount\": 366,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2004-07-22\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 1,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 3,\n        \"title\": \"Putting Children First\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"James Bartholomew\",\n        \"cat\": \"Political Science\",\n        \"description\": \"What damage is being done by failing welfare states?

Reformers across the political spectrum advocate moving these women off the welfare rolls and into the labor force as the solution to their problems. Making Ends Meet offers dramatic evidence toward a different conclusion: In the present labor market, unskilled single mothers who hold jobs are frequently worse off than those on welfare, and neither welfare nor low-wage employment alone will support a family at subsistence levels. Kathryn Edin and Laura Lein interviewed nearly four hundred welfare and low-income single mothers from cities in Massachusetts, Texas, Illinois, and South Carolina over a six year period. They learned the reality of these mothers' struggles to provide for their families: where their money comes from, what they spend it on, how they cope with their children's needs, and what hardships they suffer. Edin and Lein's careful budgetary analyses reveal that even a full range of welfare benefits—AFDC payments, food stamps, Medicaid, and housing subsidies—typically meet only three-fifths of a family's needs, and that funds for adequate food, clothing and other necessities are often lacking. Leaving welfare for work offers little hope for improvement, and in many cases threatens even greater hardship. Jobs for unskilled and semi-skilled women provide meager salaries, irregular or uncertain hours, frequent layoffs, and no promise of advancement. Mothers who work not only assume extra child care, medical, and transportation expenses but are also deprived of many of the housing and educational subsidies available to those on welfare. Regardless of whether they are on welfare or employed, virtually all these single mothers need to supplement their income with menial, off-the-books work and intermittent contributions from family, live-in boyfriends, their children's fathers, and local charities. In doing so, they pay a heavy price. Welfare mothers must work covertly to avoid losing benefits, while working mothers are forced to sacrifice even more time with their children. Making Ends Meet demonstrates compellingly why the choice between welfare and work is more complex and risky than is commonly recognized by politicians, the media, or the public. Almost all the welfare-reliant women interviewed by Edin and Lein made repeated efforts to leave welfare for work, only to be forced to return when they lost their jobs, a child became ill, or they could not cover their bills with their wages. Mothers who managed more stable employment usually benefited from a variety of mitigating circumstances such as having a relative willing to watch their children for free, regular child support payments, or very low housing, medical, or commuting costs. With first hand accounts and detailed financial data, Making Ends Meet tells the real story of the challenges, hardships, and survival strategies of America's poorest families. If this country's efforts to improve the self-sufficiency of female-headed families is to succeed, reformers will need to move beyond the myths of welfare dependency and deal with the hard realities of an unrewarding American labor market, the lack of affordable health insurance and child care for single mothers who work, and the true cost of subsistence living. Making Ends Meet is a realistic look at a world that so many would change and so few understand.\",\n        \"id\": 217,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=1_YWAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=1_YWAwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=single+parent+texas&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=7&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$32\",\n        \"pageCount\": 338,\n        \"publishDate\": \"1997-04-17\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 3,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Making Ends Meet\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Kari Lynn Dell\",\n        \"cat\": \"Fiction\",\n        \"description\": \"Rough and tumble, cocky and charming, bullfighter Joe Cassidy is one of the best in the business...

At least, that's what the men she snatches from under the hooves of bucking horses think. Outside the ring, she's got plenty of worries rattling her bones: her young son, her mess of a love life, and lately, her family's struggling business. When she takes matters into her own hands and hires on a hotshot new bullfighter, she expects to start a ruckus. She never expected stubborn, showboating, secret heart-of-gold Joe Cassidy. Joe came to Texas to escape a life spiraling out of control. He never planned on sticking around, and he certainly never expected to call this dry and dusty backwater home.

A dozen years after Dan Quayle denounced the television character Murphy Brown for making the decision to become a single mother “just another lifestyle choice,” President George W. Bush applauded single mothers for “heroic work,” and positive on-screen representations of single mothers abound, from The Gilmore Girls to Sex and the City to American Idol. Single Mother describes the recent cultural valorization of this figure that—in the midst of demographic changes in the U.S.—has emerged as the unlikely heroic and seductive voice of the new American family. Drawing on her own life as a single mother, interviews with dozens of other single mothers, cultural representations, and policies on welfare, immigration, childcare, and child custody, Juffer analyzes this contingent acceptance of single mothers. Finally, critiquing the relentless emphasis on self-sufficiency to the exclusion of community, Juffer shows the remarkable organizing skills of these new mothers of invention. At a moment when one-third of all babies are born to single moms, Single Mother is a fascinating and necessary examination of these new “domestic intellectuals.”\",\n        \"id\": 219,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=9Hfe6Jwxk88C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=9Hfe6Jwxk88C&pg=PA6&dq=single+parent+texas&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=11&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$32\",\n        \"pageCount\": 280,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2006-04-01\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 1,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 3,\n        \"title\": \"Single Mother\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Roz Denny Fox\",\n        \"cat\": \"Fiction\",\n        \"description\": \"FOR THEIR SON Texas veterinarian Delaney Blair will do anything to find a bone marrow donor for her four-year-old son, Nickolas.

In 2006, the Staubach Company advised the Brazos River Authority to begin charging a fair market rate at Possum Kingdom Lake to the people who had built their weekend homes around the shoreline. At that time, the average lake lot was three-quarters of an acre and the average rental rate was $76 per month. In 2007, Governor Rick Perry, Lt. Governor David Dewhurst, and a handful of Texas legislators attempted to force the Brazos River Authority to sell the shoreline of Possum Kingdom Lake to the wealthy weekenders at a discount. This effort was opposed by Republicans, Democrats, and bureaucrats alike, and it met a humiliating defeat. Two years later, the weekenders and the politicians enlisted the services of the River Card.

Her mother-in-law Jonita, a crusty old Texas ranching lady, along with her ex-boss, editor of a travel magazine, finally persuade Tessa to go back to work for the magazine. Her first assignment is to cover the Pacific Polo Matches on the island of Kauai. Tessa meets Armand Buteaud, captain of the French polo team and an international play boy. He sweeps her off her feet. She also meets Gil Dobson who is staying with his daughter and grandchildren in the resort compound where Tessa is housed. Gil is middle aged and a talented architect and developer who is moving his ecologically oriented business to Hawaii. Over time, Tessa is drawn more and more into her infatuation with Armand who romances her, but she finds she trusts him less and less. Gil shares his love of nature with her and takes her on several adventures on the island: sailing, flying a biplane in the canyons, beach trips with his granddaughters, dancing the night away. Tessa is drawn to him but senses that he and his family have some secret that they are not sharing with her. A near fatal accident causes Tessa to face her fears...of the water, of the past, and of new relationships. Tessa is finally able to bid aloha to her life in Texas. Carol Walt, the author, guarantees a happy ending to this novel which she calls the quintessential beach book. She researched the book while on the island of Kauai, so the descriptions of the scenery, the polo matches, the adventures and beauty on the island are as close to the reality of this lovely island as possible. Carol thinks that women who have been to Hawaii, or those who would just like to dream of going there, will enjoy this book.\",\n        \"id\": 227,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=GmiFEoB5dPcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=GmiFEoB5dPcC&pg=PA115&dq=single+parent+texas&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=24&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$9.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 169,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2007-11-09\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 3,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 3,\n        \"title\": \"Aloha, Texas!\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Julie Benson\",\n        \"cat\": \"Fiction\",\n        \"description\": \"The legendary wishing well in Wishing, Texas promises to grant wishes only if they are made for another...

Evangelical Christian nationalists—enraged after string of devastating Supreme Court defeats—had pivoted from gay to transgender, investing hundreds of millions of dollars into remaking trans youth as the new face of the anti-gay culture war. And it worked, beginning in Texas, which enacted the nation's first effective ban on treating transgender youth by redefining providing gender affirming medical care as felony child abuse, criminalizing loving parents, and sending scores of families fleeing across its borders in panic.

Miraculously, she survives, becoming the first in the family to graduate high school and attend college. The rich cultural and life-changing atmosphere of a Historical Black University is where Dee's true self-discovery begins. Outwardly, she thrives, a poster child for resilience. But privately, her life is in shambles as she wrestles with depression and demons from her past. Embarking on a desperate quest to find self-worth and purpose, as well as love from her absentee father, she turns up short, allowing her \\\"daddy issues\\\" to lead her down a bleak path of poor decision making, promiscuity, and defeat. But unbeknownst to her, she is divinely guided, protected, and powered by a seemingly invisible and everlasting presence that she later acknowledges as her \\\"help.\\\" This \\\"help\\\" energizes a vivacious raw seed, eventually revealing her purpose and developing her into a force to be reckoned with. She identifies this \\\"help\\\" after an epiphany following a breakup with an ex. A rose-from-concrete, hood, hope, and love story, Dreams Bigger Than Texas infuses comedy, insight, and faith.

Determined not to let that happen, he’ll need all the help he can get—especially from his sexy new business partner. If he can get her to take a chance on his crazy new idea, then maybe he can convince her to take a chance on him. Becky Jean Parker’s life has been anything but what she’d imagined it would be, but she’d been content until a recent turn of events once again left her no choice. Unless she wants to wallow in bankruptcy for the rest of her life, she’ll have to go along with her new business partner’s insane plan and pray he knows what he’s talking about. The only thing crazier than Ford’s plan to sell sex toys is her attraction to him. Typical of her life, she’d had no choice but to fall for the one man she can’t have. The Yankee Billionaire’s Bride Visiting the tiny town of Butte Plains, Texas to help out a friend, born and bred Yankee Scott Ramsey has no intention of falling in love, but it isn’t long before the wide open plains, and especially the meadows—Roseanne Meadows—stake a claim on his heart. The Lone Star state seems welcoming enough, but after the owner of The Yellow Rose Bed and Breakfast stole his heart, suddenly, for reasons he can’t understand, he’s relegated to carpetbagger status. What will it take to convince Roseanne his home is where his heart is? Roseanne Meadows knew better than to fall in love with a Yankee carpetbagger, but it’s too late now. What’s done is done, and the sooner Scott Ramsey packs up his toys and goes home to his venomous family, the better. Faced with an unexpected life-altering situation, in true Texan style, the owner of The Yellow Rose B&B will do whatever it takes to survive, even if it means leaving the only place her heart has ever called home. The Reluctant Billionaire Bride Growing up in tiny Butte Plains, Texas, Colin Parker longed for the bright lights of Nashville to shine on him. Unwilling to let anyone derail his up-and-coming career, Colin is determined to forget Julie Davis and the promise of the one kiss they shared, but forgetting isn’t an option. When his career skyrockets he finds himself longing for home and the woman he let get away. There’s just one problem—Julie Davis doesn’t want any part of him or his celebrity lifestyle. There are certain moments in her life Julie Davis will never forget – like the moment she realized the numbers on her winning ticket would change her life forever. And the moment she thought she’d never live to spend a penny of her winnings. Then there was the moment she kissed Colin Parker and knew there were things in life money couldn’t buy—like happiness and happily-ever-afters.

Recommended by Nicole Cliffe in Slate Featured in People Picks A Red Tricycle Best Baby and Toddler Parenting Book of the Year One of Mother magazine's favorite parenting books of the Year How Not To Hate Your Husband After Kids tackles the last taboo subject of parenthood: the startling, white-hot fury that new (and not-so-new) mothers often have for their mates. After Jancee Dunn had her baby, she found that she was doing virtually all the household chores, even though she and her husband worked equal hours. She asked herself: How did I become the 'expert' at changing a diaper? Many expectant parents spend weeks researching the best crib or safest car seat, but spend little if any time thinking about the titanic impact the baby will have on their marriage - and the way their marriage will affect their child. Enter Dunn, her well-meaning but blithely unhelpful husband, their daughter, and her boisterous extended family, who show us the ways in which outmoded family patterns and traditions thwart the overworked, overloaded parents of today. On the brink of marital Armageddon, Dunn plunges into the latest relationship research, solicits the counsel of the country's most renowned couples' and sex therapists, canvasses fellow parents, and even consults an FBI hostage negotiator on how to effectively contain an \\\"explosive situation.\\\" Instead of having the same fights over and over, Dunn and her husband must figure out a way to resolve their larger issues and fix their family while there is still time. As they discover, adding a demanding new person to your relationship means you have to reevaluate -- and rebuild -- your marriage. In an exhilarating twist, they work together to save the day, happily returning to the kind of peaceful life they previously thought was the sole province of couples without children. Part memoir, part self-help book with actionable and achievable advice, How Not To Hate Your Husband After Kids is an eye-opening look at how the man who got you into this position in this first place is the ally you didn't know you had.\",\n        \"id\": 239,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=JGGfDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=JGGfDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=childcare+for+families+with+single+parents&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=30&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$11.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 240,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2017-03-21\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 2,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"How Not to Hate Your Husband After Kids\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Eva O.

Sara suffered a debilitating fear of asserting herself. Spencer experienced crippling social anxiety. Bonnie was shut down, disconnected from her feelings. These patients all came to psychotherapist Hilary Jacobs Hendel seeking treatment for depression, but in fact none of them were chemically depressed. Rather, Jacobs Hendel found that they’d all experienced traumas in their youth that caused them to put up emotional defenses that masqueraded as symptoms of depression. Jacobs Hendel led these patients and others toward lives newly capable of joy and fulfillment through an empathic and effective therapeutic approach that draws on the latest science about the healing power of our emotions. Whereas conventional therapy encourages patients to talk through past events that may trigger anxiety and depression, accelerated experiential dynamic psychotherapy (AEDP), the method practiced by Jacobs Hendel and pioneered by Diana Fosha, PhD, teaches us to identify the defenses and inhibitory emotions (shame, guilt, and anxiety) that block core emotions (anger, sadness, fear, disgust, joy, excitement, and sexual excitement). Fully experiencing core emotions allows us to enter an openhearted state where we are calm, curious, connected, compassionate, confident, courageous, and clear. In It’s Not Always Depression, Jacobs Hendel shares a unique and pragmatic tool called the Change Triangle—a guide to carry you from a place of disconnection back to your true self. In these pages, she teaches lay readers and helping professionals alike • why all emotions—even the most painful—have value. • how to identify emotions and the defenses we put up against them. • how to get to the root of anxiety—the most common mental illness of our time. • how to have compassion for the child you were and the adult you are. Jacobs Hendel provides navigational tools, body and thought exercises, candid personal anecdotes, and profound insights gleaned from her patients’ remarkable breakthroughs. She shows us how to work the Change Triangle in our everyday lives and chart a deeply personal, powerful, and hopeful course to psychological well-being and emotional engagement.\",\n        \"id\": 243,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=s-bWDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=s-bWDgAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=parenting+by+yourself&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=6&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$8.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 322,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2018-02-06\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 2,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"It's Not Always Depression\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Lindsay C.

They fell in love, married, and soon they were raising three children from his first marriage, and later, two more of their own. Christina knew right away that there was something special about the way Ryan was parenting his kids, although she had to admit their obsession with surviving end-of-world scenarios and their ability to do everything from archery to motorcycle riding initially gave her pause. More than that, Ryan's kids were much more security savvy than most adults she knew. She soon realized he was using his CIA training and field experience in his day-to-day child-rearing. And why shouldn't he? The CIA trains its employees to be equipped to deal with just about anything. Shouldn't parents strive to do the same for their kids? As Christina grew into her new role as a stepmom and later gave birth to their two children, she got on board with Ryan's unique parenting style--and even helped shape it using her own experiences at the CIA. Told through honest and relatable parenting anecdotes, Christina shares their distinctive approach to raising confident, security-conscious, resilient children, giving practical takeaways rooted in CIA tradecraft along the way.

From birth, children are learning and rely on parents and the other caregivers in their lives to protect and care for them. The impact of parents may never be greater than during the earliest years of life, when a child's brain is rapidly developing and when nearly all of her or his experiences are created and shaped by parents and the family environment. Parents help children build and refine their knowledge and skills, charting a trajectory for their health and well-being during childhood and beyond. The experience of parenting also impacts parents themselves. For instance, parenting can enrich and give focus to parents' lives; generate stress or calm; and create any number of emotions, including feelings of happiness, sadness, fulfillment, and anger. Parenting of young children today takes place in the context of significant ongoing developments. These include: a rapidly growing body of science on early childhood, increases in funding for programs and services for families, changing demographics of the U.S. population, and greater diversity of family structure. Additionally, parenting is increasingly being shaped by technology and increased access to information about parenting. Parenting Matters identifies parenting knowledge, attitudes, and practices associated with positive developmental outcomes in children ages 0-8; universal/preventive and targeted strategies used in a variety of settings that have been effective with parents of young children and that support the identified knowledge, attitudes, and practices; and barriers to and facilitators for parents' use of practices that lead to healthy child outcomes as well as their participation in effective programs and services. This report makes recommendations directed at an array of stakeholders, for promoting the wide-scale adoption of effective programs and services for parents and on areas that warrant further research to inform policy and practice. It is meant to serve as a roadmap for the future of parenting policy, research, and practice in the United States.\",\n        \"id\": 257,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=FA8MDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=FA8MDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=parenting+by+yourself&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=30&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$59.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 525,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2016-11-21\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 3,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"Parenting Matters\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Jill Savage\",\n        \"cat\": \"Religion\",\n        \"description\": \"If you have ever forgotten to pick up your kids, accidentally worn two different shoes to the grocery store, or lost your cool over a messy house, YOU ARE NOT ALONE!

The same thing men were promised in the Declaration of Independence: happiness, or at least the freedom to pursue it. For women, though, pursuing happiness is a complicated endeavor, and if you head out into America and talk to women one-on-one, as Jill Filipovic has done, you'll see that happiness is indelibly shaped by the constraints of gender, the expectations of feminine sacrifice, and the myriad ways that womanhood itself differs along lines of race, class, location, and identity. In The H-Spot, Filipovic argues that the main obstacle standing in-between women and happiness is a rigged system. In this world of unfinished feminism, men have long been able to \\\"have it all\\\" because of free female labor, while the bar of achievement for women has only gotten higher. Never before have women at every economic level had to work so much (whether it's to be an accomplished white-collar employee or just make ends meet). Never before have the standards of feminine perfection been so high. And never before have the requirements for being a \\\"good mother\\\" been so extreme. If our laws and policies made women's happiness and fulfillment a goal in and of itself, Filipovic contends, many of our country's most contentious political issues -- from reproductive rights to equal pay to welfare spending -- would swiftly be resolved. Filipovic argues that it is more important than ever to prioritize women's happiness-and that doing so will make men's lives better, too. Here, she provides an outline for a feminist movement we all need and a blueprint for how policy, laws, and society can deliver on the promise of the pursuit of happiness for all.\",\n        \"id\": 268,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Pq7gCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pq7gCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=single+mom+resources&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=30&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$9.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 379,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2017-05-02\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 3,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"The H-Spot\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Denise Eide\",\n        \"cat\": \"Education\",\n        \"description\": \"\\\"English is so illogical!\\\" It is generally believed that English is a language of exceptions.

What if we could see the complexity of English as a powerful tool rather than a hindrance? --Denise Eide Uncovering the Logic of English challenges the notion that English is illogical by systematically explaining English spelling and answering questions like \\\"Why is there a silent final E in have, large, and house?\\\" and \\\"Why is discussion spelled with -sion rather than -tion?\\\" With easy-to-read examples and anecdotes, this book describes: - the phonograms and spelling rules which explain 98% of English words - how English words are formed and how this knowledge can revolutionize vocabulary development - how understanding the reasons behind English spelling prevents students from needing to guess The author's inspiring commentary makes a compelling case that understanding the logic of English could transform literacy education and help solve America's literacy crisis.

It's a hard blow for those already navigating high school, preparing for college, and becoming increasingly independent. Author Maya Silver was 15 when her mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2001. She and her dad, Marc, have combined their family's personal experience with advice from dozens of medical professionals and real stories from 100 teens—all going through the same thing Maya did. The topic of cancer can be difficult to approach, but in a highly designed, engaging style, this book gives practical guidance that includes: How to talk about the diagnosis (and what does diagnosis even mean, anyway?) The best outlets for stress (punching a wall is not a great one, but should it happen, there are instructions for a patch job) How to deal with friends (especially one the ones with 'pity eyes') Whether to tell the teachers and guidance counselors and what they should know (how not to get embarrassed in class) What happens in a therapy session and how to find a support group if you want one A special section for parents also gives tips on strategies for sharing the news and explaining cancer to a child, making sure your child doesn't become the parent, what to do if the outlook is grim, and tips for how to live life after cancer. My Parent Has Cancer and It Really Sucks allows teens to see that they are not alone. That no matter how rough things get, they will get through this difficult time. That everything they're feeling is ok.

After losing his father at an early age, he threw himself into the study of philosophy. The closest thing history knew to a philosopher-king, yet constant warfare and an accursed plague almost brought his empire to its knees. “Life is warfare”, he wrote, “and a sojourn in foreign land!” One thing alone could save him: philosophy, the love of wisdom!

This is the clear and urgent message of this powerful book. Based on four national surveys and drawing on more than a decade of research, Growing Up with a Single Parent sharply demonstrates the connection between family structure and a child's prospects for success. What are the chances that the child of a single parent will graduate from high school, go on to college, find and keep a job? Will she become a teenage mother? Will he be out of school and out of work? These are the questions the authors pursue across the spectrum of race, gender, and class. Children whose parents live apart, the authors find, are twice as likely to drop out of high school as those in two-parent families, one and a half times as likely to be idle in young adulthood, twice as likely to become single parents themselves. This study shows how divorce--particularly an attendant drop in income, parental involvement, and access to community resources--diminishes children's chances for well-being. The authors provide answers to other practical questions that many single parents may ask: Does the gender of the child or the custodial parent affect these outcomes? Does having a stepparent, a grandmother, or a nonmarital partner in the household help or hurt? Do children who stay in the same community after divorce fare better? Their data reveal that some of the advantages often associated with being white are really a function of family structure, and that some of the advantages associated with having educated parents evaporate when those parents separate. In a concluding chapter, McLanahan and Sandefur offer clear recommendations for rethinking our current policies. Single parents are here to stay, and their worsening situation is tearing at the fabric of our society. It is imperative, the authors show, that we shift more of the costs of raising children from mothers to fathers and from parents to society at large. Likewise, we must develop universal assistance programs that benefit low-income two-parent families as well as single mothers. Startling in its findings and trenchant in its analysis, Growing Up with a Single Parent will serve to inform both the personal decisions and governmental policies that affect our children's--and our nation's--future.\",\n        \"id\": 85,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=kLUX8BJ1exUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=kLUX8BJ1exUC&pg=PP1&dq=single+parenting&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=8&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$31\",\n        \"pageCount\": 214,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2009-07-01\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 3,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Growing Up with a Single Parent\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Linda Ranson Jacobs\",\n        \"cat\": \"Religion\",\n        \"description\": \"Whether you became a single parent through divorce, death, adoption, or some other situation, you've probably wondered what the future holds for you and your children.

Kramer and Cahn believe that all donor-conceived children’s desire to know their genetic family must be honored, and in Finding Our Families, they offer advice on how to foster healthy relationships within immediate families and their larger donor family networks based on openness and acceptance.

Dawn Walker and Matt Haviland build a compelling case that not only are single parent families the widows and orphans of this generation, but that it is the Church, not the government, that should be responsible to care for them. Drawing from their own journeys as single parents, Dawn and Matt give heartfelt encouragement to these often marginalized families by sharing how God really sees them, loves them, and wants to heal and restore them. Full of rich insights and lavish grace, they also offer some hard truths about what redemption and restoration really require.

Plus, how to avoid one of the biggest dating pitfalls: mistaking lust for love.

She’s hovering around adolescence and all of a sudden you’re flopping on the daddy-deck in a panic. What the heck is about to happen and how are you going to get through this? How can you help her get through these difficult years when honestly, you don’t totally understand it yourself? If you’re a single dad, it can get all the more complicated.

With so many parenting theories driving us all a bit batty, this is the type of book that we need to help calm things down.” —LA Times “The book is jampacked with information, but it’s also a delightful read because Oster is such a good writer.” —NPR With Expecting Better, award-winning economist Emily Oster spotted a need in the pregnancy market for advice that gave women the information they needed to make the best decision for their own pregnancies. By digging into the data, Oster found that much of the conventional pregnancy wisdom was wrong. In Cribsheet, she now tackles an even greater challenge: decision-making in the early years of parenting. As any new parent knows, there is an abundance of often-conflicting advice hurled at you from doctors, family, friends, and strangers on the internet. From the earliest days, parents get the message that they must make certain choices around feeding, sleep, and schedule or all will be lost. There's a rule—or three—for everything. But the benefits of these choices can be overstated, and the trade-offs can be profound. How do you make your own best decision? Armed with the data, Oster finds that the conventional wisdom doesn't always hold up. She debunks myths around breastfeeding (not a panacea), sleep training (not so bad!), potty training (wait until they're ready or possibly bribe with M&Ms), language acquisition (early talkers aren't necessarily geniuses), and many other topics. She also shows parents how to think through freighted questions like if and how to go back to work, how to think about toddler discipline, and how to have a relationship and parent at the same time. Economics is the science of decision-making, and Cribsheet is a thinking parent's guide to the chaos and frequent misinformation of the early years. Emily Oster is a trained expert—and mom of two—who can empower us to make better, less fraught decisions—and stay sane in the years before preschool.\",\n        \"id\": 138,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=zGJjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=zGJjDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=single+parent+childcare&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$14.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 353,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2019-04-23\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 2,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"Cribsheet\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Deborah A.

This volume provides a comprehensive portrait of lone parenthood at the beginning of the XXI century from a life course perspective. The contributions included in this volume examine the dynamics of lone parenthood in the life course and explore the trajectories of lone parents in terms of income, poverty, labour, market behaviour, wellbeing, and health. Throughout, comparative analyses of data from countries as France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Switzerland, Hungary, and Australia help portray how lone parenthood varies between regions, cultures, generations, and institutional settings. The findings show that one-parent households are inhabited by a rather heterogeneous world of mothers and fathers facing different challenges. Readers will not only discover the demographics and diversity of lone parents, but also the variety of social representations and discourses about the changing phenomenon of lone parenthood. The book provides a mixture of qualitative and quantitative studies on lone parenthood. Using large scale and longitudinal panel and register data, the reader will gain insight in complex processes across time. More qualitative case studies on the other hand discuss the definition of lone parenthood, the public debate around it, and the social and subjective representations of lone parents themselves. This book aims at sociologists, demographers, psychologists, political scientists, family therapists, and policy makers who want to gain new insights into one of the most striking changes in family forms over the last 50 years.

Organized into three main sections, the book first introduces the demographic realities using census data, then delves into practical challenges like financial strain and parental burnout, and finally investigates systemic barriers. A unique aspect of this book is its social justice framework, advocating for policy changes and community initiatives to promote equity. The book emphasizes that while single-parent families face demonstrable disadvantages, many of these challenges are intensified by societal factors, and overcoming these external barriers is essential to empowering single parents and strengthening the family unit.\",\n        \"id\": 141,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=jVNJEQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=jVNJEQAAQBAJ&pg=PT26&dq=single+parent+childcare&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=14&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$3.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 165,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2025-02-22\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 1,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"Single Parent Challenges\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Hannah Zagel\",\n        \"cat\": \"Social Science\",\n        \"description\": \"This book analyses theoretically and empirically why some single mothers are less disadvantaged than others.

Presidents and policymakers have embraced and scorned it. At times scientists have misguided it and the media has misunderstood it. Despite its longevity and renown, much of Head Start's story has never been disclosed to the general public. The Hidden History of Head Start is a detailed account of this remarkable program. Surveying projects that were forerunners of Head Start, its birth during the Johnson administration, its fate during the presidency of George W. Bush, and the many years between--as well as what the future may hold in store for Head Start--Edward Zigler and Sally Styfco offer an inside view of the program's decades of service, detailing the ever-changing waves of politics, ideology, science, media interest, and public mood that oftentimes threatened the program's very existence. Providing a balanced assessment of Head Start's effectiveness, which has been a matter of debate since its inception, the authors also strive to answer questions that continue to pervade discussions about the program and its future. For example, why is Head Start, a leader of early childhood services, still struggling to prove itself? Why does it serve such a narrow segment of the population? And how can Head Start continue its mission as universal preschool becomes a reality? The Hidden History of Head Start will be of great importance to those who shape Head Start's future, and to those who wish to develop, research, and implement new early childhood programs. Students, historians, and scholars in the fields of early intervention and developmental science, as well as policymakers, will find here an invaluable resource as well as a fascinating chronicle of one of the foremost social programs in US history.\",\n        \"id\": 143,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=2L6d9bijdDoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=2L6d9bijdDoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=single+parent+childcare&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=19&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$54.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 401,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2010-05-07\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 2,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"The Hidden History of Head Start\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"David M.

Andreas Wiedemann provides a rich study of income volatility and rising household indebtedness across OECD countries. Weaker social policies and a flexible knowledge economy have increased costs for housing, education, and raising a family - forcing many people into debt. By highlighting how credit markets interact with welfare states, the book helps explain why similar groups of people are more indebted in some countries than others.

This protracted young adulthood interacts with forces of both tradition and modernization, as social and economic changes generate profound effects on the transition from school to work, on family formation, on personal relationships, and on subjective well-being. Journey to Adulthood explores the special characteristics of young adulthood in East Asia. It uses Taiwan as illustrative example, with comparative findings from its East Asian neighbours Japan, Korea and Hong Kong. It describes the particular growth context of a millennial generation, and the challenges they face as they attempt to balance family formation, personal development and entry into a market economy.

There is wide variation across states in the strictness of welfare work requirements and in the generosity of childcare support. In addition, the level of co-payments required and the flexibility to use subsidies for informal modes of childcare differ across states, leading families to make different childcare and employment choices. The purpose of From Welfare to Childcare is first to describe what changes occurred in childcare following the 1996 welfare reform legislation, and then to analyze how federal welfare and subsidy policies influence the availability, accessibility, and quality of childcare arrangements for single mothers with young children. National in scope, it focuses on how the reforms influence the way that children are cared for when their mothers leave welfare and enter the workforce. This book is suitable for national, state, and local policymakers, non-profit organizations that study and attempt to influence public policy, and scholars interested in family and social policy issues.

Stone presents the definitive discussion of housing and social justice in the United States. Challenging the conventional definition of housing affordability, Stone offers original and powerful insights about the nature, causes, and consequences of the affordability problem and presents creative and detailed proposals for solving a problem that afflicts one-third of this nation. Setting the housing crisis into broad political, economic, and historical contexts, Stone asks: What is shelter poverty? Why does it exist and persist? and How can it be overcome? Describing shelter poverty as the denial of a universal human need, Stone offers a quantitative scale by which to measure it and reflects on the social and economic implications of housing affordability in this country. He argues for \\\"the right to housing\\\" and presents a program for transforming a large proportion of the housing in this country from an expensive commodity into an affordable social entitlement. Employing new concepts of housing ownership, tenure, and finance, he favors social ownership in which market concepts have a useful but subordinate role in the identification of housing preferences and allocation. Stone concludes that political action around shelter poverty will further the goal of achieving a truly just and democratic society that is also equitably and responsibly productive and prosperous.\",\n        \"id\": 169,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=35g2jypRxn0C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=35g2jypRxn0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=single+parent+housing&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=15&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$29.95\",\n        \"pageCount\": 438,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2010-08-12\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 1,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"Shelter Poverty\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Clare Cooper Marcus, Wendy Sarkissian\",\n        \"cat\": \"Architecture\",\n        \"description\": \"From the Introduction: Consider these two places: Walking into Green Acres, you immediately sense that you have entered an oasis-traffic noise left behind, negative urban distractions out of sight, children playing and running on the grass, adults puttering on plant-filled balconies.

This is a place that people are proud of, a place that children will remember in later years with nostalgia and affection, a place that just feels \\\"good.\\\" Contrast this with Southside Village. Something does not feel quite right. It is hard to find your way about, to discern which are the fronts and which are the backs of the houses, to determine what is \\\"inside\\\" and what is \\\"outside.\\\" Strangers cut across what might be a communal backyard. There are no signs of personalization around doors or on balconies. Few children are around; those who are outside ride their bikes in circles in the parking lot There are few signs of caring; litter, graffiti, and broken light fixtures indicate the opposite. There is no sense of place; it is somewhere to move away from, not somewhere to remember with pride. These are not real locations, but we have all seen places like them. The purpose of this book is to assist in the creation of more places like Green Acres and to aid in the rehabilitation of the many Southside Villages that scar our cities.

It is intended as a reference tool, primarily for housing designers and planners, but also for developers, housing authorities, citizens' groups, and tenants' organizations-anyone involved in planning or rehabilitating housing. It provides guidelines for the layout of buildings, open spaces, community facilities, play areas, walkways, and the myriad components that make up a housing site.

Single mothers, by contrast, almost always work, regardless of the age of their children. Despite their eagerness to support themselves and their children through employment, their average income remains low and many live on a household budget close to the poverty line. This book examines how the difficult living conditions facing single mothers in Japan highlight not only the challenges they face in earning a family wage and managing the work-family balance, but also reveals the class dimensions of family life in contemporary Japan. The need to make ends meet with few resources means that mothers may find it difficult to uphold the lifestyle they may consider as most appropriate for the upbringing of their children, and that they may have to choose between their presence at home, in line with the ideal of the middle-class housewife and mother, or devoting more time to earning an income that can pay for a good education. Social class, in this case, is not just a matter of education, occupation, or income, but is also expressed by mothers’ approaches to their children’s’ upbringing and future opportunities in education and employment. Based on life history interviews with single mothers, this study examines the gendered meanings of social class and social achievement and the role of maternal practices in shaping their children’s future life trajectories.\",\n        \"id\": 171,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=c8MCDAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=c8MCDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA62&dq=single+parent+housing&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=25&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$44.5\",\n        \"pageCount\": 157,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2016-05-12\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 1,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 1,\n        \"title\": \"Single Mothers in Contemporary Japan\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Oscar Newman\",\n        \"cat\": \"City planning\",\n        \"description\": \"The appearance of Oscar Newman's Defensible SpaceÓ in 1972 signaled the establishment of a new criminological subdiscipline that has come to be called by many Crime Prevention Through Environmental DesignÓ or CPTED.

For most people, well-being involves more than a high income or material prosperity alone. Many non-material aspects, such as health, family life, living environment, job quality and the meaningful use of time are at least as important. Together, these factors also influence the degree to which people are satisfied with their lives, and help to determine how happy they feel. This book argues that happiness and life satisfaction do not form a good basis for measuring well-being, and proposes an alternative method that not only considers the various aspects of well-being, but also the fact that people have their own views on what is important in life. Not limited just to theory, the book also presents a large-scale, representative survey involving more than 3000 adults from over 2000 Belgian families, which charted the various aspects of the individual well-being of Belgians. Focusing on the unequal distribution of these various aspects of well-being within families, the survey showed that some Belgians are more likely to suffer from cumulative deprivation in multiple dimensions. Based on this innovative study, the book describes which people in society are worst off – and these are not necessarily only people on low incomes or those who feel unhappy – and proposes that policymakers prioritise these individuals.\",\n        \"id\": 173,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=qzkCEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=qzkCEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA126&dq=single+parent+housing&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=32&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$89\",\n        \"pageCount\": 187,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2020-10-09\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 1,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"Well-being in Belgium\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Diane Ehrensaft\",\n        \"cat\": \"Psychology\",\n        \"description\": \"If you need help having a baby, reproductive technology can supply the answer.

A single woman harboring a deep ambivalence about motherhood, Kowalski needed to decide once and for all: Did she want a baby or not? More importantly, with no partner on the horizon, did she want to have a baby alone? Once she revised her idea of motherhood—from an experience she would share with a partner to a journey she would embark upon alone—the answer came up a resounding Yes. After exploring her options, Kowalski chose to conceive using a sperm donor, but her plan stopped short when a doctor declared her infertile. How far would she go to make motherhood a reality? Kowalski catapulted herself into a diligent regimen of herbs, Qigong, meditation, acupuncture, and more, in a quest to improve her chances of conception. Along the way, she delved deep into spiritual healing practices, facing down demons of self-doubt and self-hatred, ultimately discovering an unconventional path to parenthood. In the end, to become a mother, Kowalski did everything she said she would never do. And she wouldn't change a thing. A story of personal triumph and unconditional love, Motherhood Reimagined reveals what happens when we release what's expected and embrace what's possible.\",\n        \"id\": 180,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=lEgzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=lEgzDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=single+parent+resources&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=35&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$12.99\",\n        \"pageCount\": 312,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2017-10-17\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 2,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 2,\n        \"title\": \"Motherhood Reimagined\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"author\": \"Joan D Atwood, Frank Genovese\",\n        \"cat\": \"Family & Relationships\",\n        \"description\": \"Provide effective counseling to members of single-parent families With more than half of all first marriages ending in divorce, it’s time to re-think the notion that “divorce” means “failure.” Therapy with Single Parents focuses on the strengths of the single-parent family rather than its weaknesses, stressing the need to look at the socially constructed norms, values, and definitions associated with marriage and family in order to provide effective counseling. This unique book examines experiences that are common to single parents and presents interventive strategies for treating single-parent family issues, drawing on clinical case studies to provide technical knowledge in everyday language. Current research shows that single parents account for 27 percent of family households that include children under 18 and that the number of single mothers in the United States more than tripled between 1970 and 2000. Therapy with Single Parents challenges outdated notions that the single-parent family is somehow deficient and associated with adjustment problems in children. It doesn’t ignore the anger, pain, sadness, and guilt experienced by many members of single parent families but offers therapeutic considerations from a more balanced approach. The book examines the social, psychological, and sexual experiences of newly single parents and addresses the ups and downs they’ll face in dealing with schools, the workplace, and social services. Therapy with Single Parents examines: social and psychological differences between divorce and widowhood cognitive-behavioral principles of single-parent families what children can learn from divorce dealing with the ghosts of past relationships relationship rules dealing with adult children and extended families the effect of change in divorcing families the feminization of poverty the therapeutic value of social networks Therapy with Single Parents is an invaluable resource for psychologists, professional counselors, social workers, and marriage and family therapists. The book presents a thorough, in-depth examination of the single-parent family system as a viable, healthy family form.\",\n        \"id\": 128,\n        \"image\": \"https://books.google.com/books/content?id=Dn_sAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"link\": \"http://books.google.com/books?id=Dn_sAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA297&dq=single+father+parenting&hl=&as_pt=BOOKS&cd=19&source=gbs_api\",\n        \"listPrice\": \"$62.95\",\n        \"pageCount\": 342,\n        \"publishDate\": \"2014-02-25\",\n        \"related_childcare_id\": 1,\n        \"related_housing_id\": 3,\n        \"title\": \"Therapy with Single Parents\"\n    }\n]"

From finding out that her baby is a boy (and getting used to the idea) to finding out that her best friend and greatest supporter Pam will die of cancer (and not getting used to that idea), with a generous amount of wit and faith (but very little piousness), Lamott narrates the great and small events that make up a woman’s life. \\\"Lamott is a wonderfully lithe writer ....
